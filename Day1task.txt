     Blog about objects and its internal representation in JavaScript 

	1. Objects is the most important data type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
	2. The objects are different from JavaScript’s primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, Undefined and symbol.
	3. These primitive data – type all stores single value depending on their types.
	4. It is complex and contain any primitive data types.
	5. Object is a reference data type.
	6. Object may be defined as unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types in the form of “key-value”.	
	7. These Keys are functions or variables and are called properties and methods in the context of an object.	
	8. “A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behaviour (properties and method)”.
            The following assigns a following Bike example for objects.

             S.No	   Property	Property Value
              1.	    Make	   TVS
              2.	    Model	   APACHE
              3.	    Colour	   Black
              4.	    Fuel	   Petrol
              5.	    Weight	   174 Kg
              6.	    Mileage	   47 Kmpl
              7.	    Rating 	   4.5

          Syntax to access property from an object

          ObjectName.property               //              Bike. Make.

          So, conclusion and simple definition for JavaScript Properties is “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”.

        9.. Object  methods in an object property containing a function definition.

        10. Function (){return ignition. On} similar to start/stop/brake on and off.
        11. So, Conclusion and simple definition for JavaScript object methods is “Methods are actions that can be performed on an object.
